SamsokProxy
===========

A Python proxy needed to run SamsokJS. It runs on Google App Engine and serves remote URLs as JSONP.

To run or deploy it the App Engine SDK is needed: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads

If you are planning on deploying your own instance you will have to change the app name in app.yaml to whatever app name you have registered with GAE.
